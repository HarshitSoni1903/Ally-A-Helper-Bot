Hop, freshman toads! Hop!
Let's move it!


We worked out all summer.
Rock hard.

Hey, you know what? Why
don't you guys get a room?

Just 1,385 days.

In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister,
Candace, and her boyfriend, Derek...

would have let me eat lunch
with their Earth Club.

Seniors only.

What are you doing with
that plastic spork?

I don't wanna bring
back silverware.

Derek, you're Earth Club treasurer.
Come on!

When my sister said
"No," I thought...

maybe my old friend Susan would
wanna have lunch with me.

In middle school, Susan was
very fun to be around...

but now she doesn't like
to say "Hi" to me anymore.

And then there's Brad Hays.

Before my older brother went to
play football for Penn State...

he and Brad played together...

so I thought maybe
he'd say "Hi" to me.

But Brad's a senior.

And I'm me. So who am I kidding?

On the bright side...

one senior decided to make fun of the
teacher instead of the freshmen.

He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
legendary goatee...

with a grease pencil.

<font color="#D900D9">(STUDENTS LAUGHING)</font>

The prick punch is not a toy.

I learned that back
in 'Nam in '68.

"Callahan," sergeant said...

"you put down that prick punch."

"You go kill some gooks."

And you know what happened?

That prick punch killed my best
friend in a Saigon whorehouse.

<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font> I heard you were
gonna be in my class.

Are you proud to be a senior...

having to take freshman
shop, Patty-Cakes?

Look, my name is Patrick.

Either you call me Patrick
Or you call me nothing.

Okay, Nothing.

<font color="#808080">BOY NARRATING:</font>
I felt really bad for Patrick.

He wasn't doing the impersonation
to be mean or anything.

He was just trying to make
us freshmen feel better.

Nothing, why don't
you read first?

All right. "Chapter One."

"Surviving your fascist
shop teacher..."

"who needs to put kids
down to feel big."

Oh, wow, this is useful, guys.
We should read on.

<font color="#D900D9">(STUDENTS LAUGHING)</font>

My last class of the day
is Advanced English...

and I'm really excited
to finally learn...

with the smartest
kids in the school.

Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.

Believe it or not, she's gotten
straight A's since kindergarten.

Shh!

I'm Mr. Anderson.

I'm gonna be your teacher
for freshman English.

This semester we're
gonna learn about...

Harper Lee's To
Kill a Mockingbird.

Genius book.

Now, who'd like to get out
of the first pop quiz?

I'm shocked. All right. Well,
you can skip the quiz...

if you tell me which author
invented the paperback book.

Anyone?

He was British.

He also invented the serial.

In fact, at the end of the third
chapter of his first novel...

he had a man hanging from a
cliff by his fingernails.

Hence the term "cliff hanger."

Anybody?

- Yeah?
- Shakespeare.

That's a great guess, but no.

Shakespeare didn't write novels.

Anybody else?

Hmm?

The author...

was Charles Dickens.

However, if you and I had
gone to a Shakespeare play...

it would have cost
us four pennies.

Can you imagine that?

We would have put those
pennies in a metal box.

The ushers would lock
it in the office.

And that's where
we get the term...

I mean, come on, "spaz"?

You know, I heard you had
a tough time last year.

But they say if you
make one friend...

on your first day,
you're doing okay.

Thank you, sir, but if
my English teacher...

is the only friend
I make today...

that would be sort
of depressing.

Hey, freshman toad.

<font color="#808080">BOY NARRATING:</font> Well,
I have 1,384 days to go.

Just so I say it to someone...

high school is even worse
than middle school.

If my parents ask me about it...

I probably won't tell
them the truth...

because I don't want them...

to worry that I might
get bad again.

If my Aunt Helen were still
here, I could talk to her...

and I know she would
understand...

how I'm both happy and sad.

And I'm still trying to
figure out how that could be.

I just hope I make
a friend soon.

nervous now, huh, Champ?

Yes, sir. I sure do.

give 'em a smile...

<font color="#808080">CHARLIE:</font> I probably should
have been honest about...

how I didn't want to go out with
Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but...

I really didn't want
to hurt her feelings.

You see, Mary Elizabeth is
a really nice person...

underneath the part of
her that hates everyone.

Hey!

And since I heard that having a
girlfriend makes you happy...

I tried hard to love
her like I love Sam.

Can you believe it's almost
our 2-week anniversary?

Yeah, I know.

So I took her on double dates.

Vegans don't eat butter.

<font color="#808080">CHARLIE:</font> And I tried not to mind
that she loves to hold hands...

even when her hands are sweaty.

And I had to admit something
really upsetting, but...

I'm tired of touching her boobs.

I thought maybe if she would just
let me pick the make-out music...

once in a while, we
might have a chance.

And maybe if she didn't put down the
books that Mr. Anderson gives me.

Walden.

I read this in 7th grade.

I would have called
it On Boring Pond.

Or if she would stop calling me the
minute I get home from school...

when I have absolutely nothing to talk
about other than the bus ride home.

Somehow she finds
new things to say.

were some very bad days.</i>

<i>And some unexpected
beautiful days.</i>

<i>The worst day was the time my
doctor told my mom and dad...</i>

<i>what Aunt Helen did to me.</i>

Honey?

I'm so sorry.

<i>The best days were those
when I could have visitors.</i>

<i>My brother and sister
always came for those...</i>

<i>until Chris had to
go to training camp.</i>

<i>He's going to be first
string this year.</i>

<i>My sister told me she met a
nice guy at her summer job.</i>

Here he is.

So I'll see you Thursday
at 6:00, right?

- Okay.
- You gonna hang in there?

<i>My doctor said we can't
choose where we come from...</i>

<i>but we can choose where
we go from there.</i>

<i>I know it's not all
the answers...</i>

<i>but it was enough to start
putting these pieces together.</i>

God bless this food we
are about to receive.

We thank you for this bounty...

in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, Amen.

- Amen.
- Amen.

How do you think the Penguins
are gonna do this year, Dad?

Goddamn Penguins.

Think they're allergic
to goddamn defense.

What do the players
call a puck again?

A biscuit.

Are you sure it's not
a "goddamn biscuit"?

You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

<font color="#808080">MOTHER:</font> Honey, I think
we're gonna have to do...

a little shopping for you
before you take off, huh?

- Yeah, I need some books.
- <font color="#808080">MOTHER:</font> Clothes, too.

Yeah.

Can Charlie come out and play?

The first night, we
had grilled stickies.

So good.

You have to visit in the fall.
We'll have some, okay?

Definitely.

Oh, sorry...

Charlie has a breakdown
scheduled for October.

Well, can I tell you something?

I've been away for two months.

It's another world.

And it gets better.

And my roommate Katie has
the best taste in music.

I found the tunnel song.

Let's drive.
