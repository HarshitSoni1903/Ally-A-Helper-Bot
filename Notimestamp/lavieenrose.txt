- Why are you crying?
- Get outta here, you brats!

I get bored.

It's a lifelong

- I gotta earn a living. I'm a singer!
- Look at the state of your daughter!

I look after her very well!

Yeah, sure, Clemenceau sends his regards.

What have we here?

Your granddaughter, Edith.

What an odd name.

Not too healthy looking.

Come with me.

What are you doing here?

What a cutie! What's your name?

- Got nothing better to do, Titine?
- The upstairs toilet's busy.

You got lovely blue eyes, you know?

I'm listening.

I gotta get back.

I'll be demobbed soon.
Then I'll go back to being an acrobat.

- I came to see the little pumpkin.
- Get out!

- I'm done with my customers, Mama Louise.
- Watch the entrance.

Where's her mother?

Dunno.

You wanna leave her here?!

- People will talk.
- They've always got something to say.

Isn't she coming to Mass?

- We'll miss the sermon.
- The world doesn't revolve around her.

- I heard we have a baby.
- May we see her?

- Not a baby, a girl. Want some bread?
- C'mon, bugger off, everybody.

You could sing at the Casino de Paris

The moon suddenly appeared,

A heartfelt cry.

And me in the water,

I, too, cried "oh!"
<i>? Moi j'ai fait "Ho !"</i>

He saw me naked.

Titine!
Open up, that's enough, now.

- What's she up to, now?
- She's in there with Edith.

- Open this door, now! - No!
- What's the matter with her?

Nothing. Go get ready.
The customers will soon be here.

- Open up, or you'll regret it!
- I can't work.

- I can't work.
- You don't wanna work?

- What do you think this is, a hotel?
- I'll watch Edith, tonight.

You're not gonna watch anything.

It's me. Allez, open up.
Your Legionnaire's here tonight.

I don't care. He's a liar,

A toast to all who are waiting
for me to fail.

All who think they've fooled me.

- A problem, Louis?
- Don't worry it's just his usual moping.

You should go, now, we're busy.

You're not here to enjoy the show.
Lace me up.

You can't be a child, here.

You're here to earn your keep.

<i>I've had it with you!

<i>Louis, we're all in this mess
together, so lend a hand!

- I don't give a shit!
- Then, get out!

Don't leave just like that,
in a fit of anger!

I can't stand having a boss!
Especially Caroli, he's a bad boss.

- You've had too much to  drink.
- I'll earn more on my own.

Where would you do that?
Circuses don't grow on trees.

I've always managed very well, alone.

- I was just getting used to you.
- Well get un-used to me!

Got any change?

What if I don't come?

Do as you wish, my girl.

You're out and about all day,

I place my trust in you,
and you bring me this?

I kept a bit for my father.
He's sick and broke.

- So, now, I'm funding Salvation Army?!
- I swear, it's true, he's sick.

I'll pimp you out on the streets,

then you'll see
what it means to work.

Let her go!

Never, never! I'd rather blow
my brains out than turn tricks!

If she offs herself,
it'll be your fault.

Shut your trap!

I want more, got that?

Or you'll spread your thighs,
like the others.

Spread your own thighs.

Albert, I'm sorry!

- Stay, I'm begging you!
- Let that asshole go.

Etienne, give her a drink.

- Wanna come with us, to the Chinese?
- Who's "us"?

The two Italians, le Gros, Popoche.

Plenty of what it takes: coke, opium.
And a bit of human warmth.

Just because I slept with you once,

doesn't mean I'll sleep with you
every night, all right?

- Stop it.
- Shall I explain?

I don't give a fuck about your crap,
you know why?

Huh, no? You dumb cunt.
Because, I'm an artiste.

And I'm gonna make it.
I know it. I've always known it!

It's my little flame.

- Denise Jay.
- Ah, Jay.

- Oh, you do your nails!
- That's not the point.

- You make me think of a bird.
- Oh yeah? How'bout that?

<i>La Môme, Moineau* is taken.
- Yes, taken.</i> (*Kid, Sparrow)

Sparrow...

<i>Where you're from a sparrow is 'piaf'?
That's it, eh, piaf?</i>

- La Môme, Piaf.
- Stroke of genius!

- La Môme, Piaf* is kinda dumb.
- Nonsense! (The Kid, Piaf)

- La Môme Piaf!
- Truly, a stroke of genius!

You'll need repertoire worthy of
your name: Nini peau de chien,

La Valse brune, all Bruant's classics,
Les Mômes de la Cloche...

- That one, I know!
- Work on them every night, if need be.

You start, Friday.

Evening, Madame,
show's about to start.

- Better check on your "Kid".
- What is it?

- Seems she likes the sauce.
- I'm on my way.

Philippo, no more alcohol backstage.

- What are you up to?
- I hadn't finished knitting it.

- I'm fixing the sleeve.
- Now?! With a full house?

All the more reason!
She can't go on looking like a vagrant!

Look, our star singer,
dressing the newcomer.

- Yeah, that's right.
- Girls, let's hurry.

- I feel like I'm gonna barf.
- Now's not the time. Hurry up.

A few days ago, on my way home,
chance, or destiny led me

to cross paths with
the lady you'll see tonight.

Here she is, exactly as I first
saw her: a diamond in the rough.

Thank you.

Come, Edith.

You've got them now, and tomorrow,
and every night after that.

I'm going to introduce you to someone
who can do a lot for you.

<i>Bravo Mademoiselle,
you have a lot of talent.</i>

<i>Bravo!</i>

Good evening, my name is
Marguerite Monnot. I'm a pianist.

If, someday, you need music,
I'd be delighted compose for you.

Thank you.

What's with her?

Marvellous, marvellous.

So many handshakes, tonight!
Have more champagne.

- Pass the bottle.
- Here you are.

I told him to trust me
on the power of radio

didn't I, my dear Coquatrix?

My dear Jacques, don't underestimate
the magic of the Music Hall.

Of course not.

Edith, I've thought up something for you.

- A song?
- Of course.

Raymond!
Mireille, call Raymond.

Raymond !

- There's somebody here for you.
- Somebody's here for you, la Mome!

That fat guy wants to see you.

This is Raymond Asso.

- I want a word.
- Excuse me.

Oh, yeah? I don't love your mug.

I've come to see you, often.

He was a discreet man...

- Weren't you here yesterday?
- Yes, but I didn't see him.

- So he may have stayed home.
- Perhaps. It's sad.

He was discreet,
so amiable and helpful.

<i>You're a bird of ill omen!

It's her fault!

Would you come with me, please.

- Why?
- Follow me.

Pardon, let us pass, please.

Well?... Hey, I'm talking to you.

- Are you in the mob, or not?
- No.

Leave me alone.

And Henri Valette?

Georges le Spahi? Jeannot le Mataf?
And Albert?...

Don't know them, either?

They're friends, but, they've
got nothing to do with this.

Accessory to a crime
could carry a long stretch.

I'm innocent! I've done nothing
and lost everything.

Where were you last night?

I told you: at a party.

Bastards, scumbags!
You're disgusting!

Hey, calm down, you're not
in a music-hall, here!

You hang out with shady characters
and you know a certain 'Albert'.

- I don't know anybody, Inspector.
- That's it, play me for a sap.

- Do you have anything to say?
- Look, this is not the time.

- Leave her alone!
- She deserves to be shamed!

- Do you have connections to the mob?
- Slut! - Leave her alone!

- It wasn't her!
- Have you named names?

This is a funeral.
Have some dignity!

- One last question.
- You shit-distubers, piss off!

Out of the way!
Get the hell outta here!

<i>I'm finished, dead.

No one ever dragged me

<i>Open up!

- What?
- Are you Simone Berteaut?

Yes.

Mlle Simone Berteaut,
you need to come with us.

Why? I haven't done anything!

The court and your mother
have agreed to place you

in a girl's boarding school.

This decision is effective
immediately.

Get your things, please.

No! Am I dreaming?!
She stays here!

I won't discuss this with you.

For the last time, young lady,
get your things.

You want to see me dead!
Is that it, huh?

- Let me go!
- She's not leaving. Momone!

Edith, don't let them take me!

Will you calm down!

My things! I don't have my things!
Do you hear, you son of a whore?

- Watch the insults!

I don't want anyone in this
dressing room! Leave me!

Mamie, you stay.

I need an injection,
I'm in such pain, look.

Get me the American.

You can come in, now.

What a success!
Edith, you're magnificent.

Doug?

I need air.

I wanna go back home to Châlons.
With you.

- Now?
- Edith,...

we're 400 kilometres away.

You bore the shit outta me!
I'm sick of you all!

Edith, you're exhausted.

We can't drive 400 km
in the middle of the night.

'No, no', always 'no'!
I shit on your 'no'!!

- We go!
- No way!

Let's go back.

- I wanna go back, turn around!
- What?

- Turn around, you ruined the mood!
- What's the?...

<i>The blood test is a catastrophe.</i>

that can't be put in a cast.

cancel them, M. Barrier.</i>

It's tight enough. Leave me.

Hurry Doctor, give me a shot
so I can sing.

Sorry, my admiration
does have bounds.

They know no bounds, out there,
and neither do I.

Cancel the concert, Mme Piaf.
You're playing with your life.

So what? You gotta have
something to play with.

<i>If you wanna clean up your act,
you gotta change your set.

- 'Myself'?
- Your 'set'. Your living quarters.

Why didn't you call me sooner?

I was busy with stuff.

And I didn't know what
you wanted with me.

I heard you sing every night
at Leplée's. You have a lot to learn.

You're the first one to say that.

In 3 months you won't be

No more cabaret gimmicks.

Il avait "DE"

Do you understand what you sing
or do you just make noises?

- What do you want?
- Perfect diction!

- No such thing, I sing like I speak!
- Badly.

You mangle the words

and you understand nothing
of what you sing.

More slowly, Marguerite.

We've been at it six hours.
Can we open a window?

<i>We'll breathe later.

From the top.

<i>? Il avait de grands yeux très clairs

You're not hearing me!
You embody none of the meaning.

You must become this woman
in love.

Think like an actress.

He's making fun of me.

We're tired, Raymond.
We need a break.

This guy makes me feel
like I can't sing.

Who are you? Where did you sing?

Don't be content with what you CAN do!

I've been singing since I was 9!

Don't worry, this is normal.

You've never done it before,
it's difficult.

You must interpret!
You know what that means?

You must LIVE the song!

No one's ever told me
I can't articulate.

No one? Who do you mean?

Lounge lizards at Gerny's?
Pedestrians on the street?

You, either, do what I say,
or go back where you came from!

Edith! Edith!

Here's to my little girl,
who hasn't forgotten her papa!

La Môme*! (Kid)

You look well cared for,
is he loaded?

Not a penny. It's love of art.

For the love of your ass!

A song! A song!

You're stiff. Like you've been
planted there. Lifeless.

Like a brilliant boxer who's
content with street-fights.

The stage is a whole package.

You must interest them
in all you have.

You have marvellous hands.
Use them.

Sing with them.

"personne"

Slip this on.

People don't want this crap.
It's the voice they're interested in.

How can you be so talented
and so dense at the same time?

Put it on.

- Edith, open this door.
<i>- No, I gotta puke!

- Is she drunk?

I have a full house waiting!

You've been pestering me
for weeks to get this venue.

Get her outta the shitter
and onstage

before they tear the place apart.

She'll be there!

Edith, I'll give you 3 minutes.

<i>Asso, this isn't a cabaret,
it's a music-hall!

What shit did I get myself into!

It's nothing, Edith, just
stage fright. It's a good sign.

Yeah.

<i>We're there, Edith.

<i>You worked, you listened to me,
you believed me.

I can't believe
you're flinching, now.

"I know this room!
I know it..."

You'll be great. I can't wait
to see you in the theater.

Look out, Canetti's coming.

- Edith, the conductor's been
waiting three hours. - And?...

And you're premiering at the
Bobino in less than 48 hours.

Do you know many people, for whom
Jean Cocteau's written a play? Eh?

<i>- Mademoiselle</i>
- Yes, Suzanne?

M. Paul Meurisse called.

He'll pick you up at eight
for dinner at M. Cocteau's.

You see? Ask our conductor
to come back at midnight.

Are you sure?

Don't nag her like Raymond.
"Do this, do that..."

- That's why she fired that
ball-breaker. - Stop it!

- Would you like to see the gowns?
- Ah, yes, the gowns.

Voilà. That's all of them, Mlle Piaf.
Watch out for the pins.

The simplest one, without the collar.

A young man has been calling
since yesterday.

Says he has something for you.

- What's he like?
- A soldier.

I told him several times you had no time.
Now, he's here in the corridor.

- It's getting embarrassing.
- Since he's here, let him in.

Follow me.

- Put that, there.
- Merci.

- Here, please.
<i>- Voila, much better without the collar.

Well?

My name is Michel Emer.
I'm a corporal...

I have a song for you.

Another one? My repertoire is full.

I open at the Bobino, the day
after tomorrow. Come back later.

I want this one.

You can't be serious.
We're already late.

What isn't serious?

Play it.
I want it for Bobino.

Allez, allez!

Edith, you can't do that.

Oh, can't I?!

What's the point of being
Edith Piaf, then?

<i>"She is so desesperated..."</i>

<i>In French, please.

<i>- "She's too desperate, too needy."</i>
- Get to the point, Charles.

I'm not a translator.

"Miserable. Certainly not an
heir
to the French Can-Can nor Gay Paris."

That's what you call a flop.

Edith, it's not the first time
you've had to fight.

Loulou, the Yanks want pretty girls,
this is no place for me.

Let's not push our luck. I'm not
the sexy Parisienne they expected.

Go ahead and laugh, Ginou.
I don't connect, over here.

I'm too sad for them,
they're too stupid for me.

Yeah, too stupid for us.

Edith, it's marvellous!
Extraordinary! Look at this.

No-no-no, here, here!

- Edith, you made the front page!
- And two columns!

This is excellent for us.
This is Virgil Thomson.

He's the most influential
theater critic in America.

This is an important article,
full of praise!

"Ze American audience
ees sometimes stupeed and..."

I can't make heads or tails of this.
Translate it, for fuck's sake!

They say that they shouldn't let you go.
That it would be a grave error.

And that the Americans
don't deserve you. Voilà.

I knew something would happen!
I gotta change.

Ginou, come help me choose
an outfit.

Tonight, I'm going out...
on a date.

<i>Your Pastrami!</i>

Enjoy.

- What's this, Marcel?
- Beef. Go on, taste it.

Smells like a wet dog.

A problem with the meat?

What?

It's ok!
She is... She don't...

It's ok.

Your English seems about
as good as the sandwich.

Don't like the decor?

I'm a bit surprised.
I wasn't expecting...

When you called to invite me
to a restaurant and said,

we're two French people alone in
New York, perhaps we could dine together,

- I imagined something else.
- I come here all the time.

Boy, when you invite a girl out,
there's no risk of financial ruin!

- We'll have two pastramis...

Ah, no! Let me do this.

Dex Tournedos Rossini, <i>with</i> un
Château L'Angelus 1938, <i>please.</i>

- You must be starving.
- It's better than eating boiled dog.

I'm sorry.

No regets, let's start over.
Okay?

Okay. How long have you been
in New York?

Eight weeks.

And do you like America?

I don't give toss about America.

I don't understand them,
and they don't understand me.

- You must miss Paris.
<i>- Terribly.

What do you do
when you're not singing?

Oh, I say!

You could work at the Quai des
Orfèvres* (Police Headquarters)

I knit.

If you give me your measurements
I'll knit you a sweater.

No, no need...

- I think those people recognize you.
- Oh, yeah?

They must be saying:

Look at that guy; lost his last
two fights. He's totally screwed.

- I'll go shut their yaps.
- No, no!

Don't panic, I'm joking.

Very good.

Can we use informal pronouns? (tu)
- Sure.

- What do you do when you aren't boxing?
- I train. I run.

- And after the training?
- At home, in Morocco? I work on my farm.

You have a farm?

I have a pig farm.

What? Why not?

That's right, why not?

It's a fine, modern farm,
with nice, fat pigs.

- Who looks after them
when you're boxing? - My wife.

You have...

...magnificent hands.

<i>- D'you hear that, Momone?
- It's true, you have nice fingers.

<i>Listen.

<i>What colour are your eyes?

- He leaned over to get a closer look.
- Did his breath reek?

You're such a twat,
when you set your mind to it!

What? If he's a pig farmer...

- He said...
- Blue-mauve.

<i>Yeah, so? Blue-mauve...

<i>It was the way he said it.

As though he was a child.

- Then he said:
<i>- You're like some magical fairy.

That's a bit of an exaggeration.

<i>- D'you kiss him?
- I didn't dare.

- It was a very nice evening.
- Too short.

- Will you come see me box?
- Oh, yeah, for sure.

Did he try to kiss you?

- Dunno if he even thought about it.
<i>- Like hell, he didn't! Get outta-here!

I'll come see you sing.

Um, well... Goodnight.

<i>He's the love of my life.

<i>? And though I close my eyes</i>

<i>? I see la vie en rose</i>

<i>? When you press me to your heart</i>

<i>? I'm in a world apart</i>

<i>? A world where roses bloom</i>

<i>? And when you speak
Angels sing</i>

<i>? from above</i>

<i>? Everyday words
Seem to turn into love songs</i>

<i>? Give your heart and soul to me</i>

<i>? And life will always be</i>

<i>? La vie en rose</i>

<i>That's it.</i>

You were marvellous!

Mr. Lucien Roupp,
Mr. Cerdan's manager.

Mr. Jameson,
of CBS Television Network.

This might not be the time,
but, perhaps you....

Marlene.

Good evening. I'm sorry,
I just came to say a word.

It's been a long time,
since I've seen Paris.

But this evening, as you sang,
Edith, I was there.

On its streets, beneath its sky.

Your voice is like the soul of Paris.

You made me travel back.
You made me cry.

- Thank you, with all of my heart.
- Thank you.

- Thank you for the discretion.
- Thank you, Sir.

Climb up!

I'm beginning to like this city.

The stars are out tonight.

Come, let's go.

<i>Marc, do you know how long
a frog lives?

In fairytales or in real life?

I've never read any fairytales,
to anyone.

You never had the chance, Edith?

I have, but I didn't do it.

that'd be April,

I will triumph at the Olympia,

I'll fill their coffers
and we're back on top!

Edith, your liver cells
no longer function normally.

You've been ill, you need rest.
This is serious.

I just turned 44.
I'm not in my grave, yet.

We have no working capital,
after all those cancellations.

Is it my fault, Loulou, huh?

I didn't say that, Edith.
It's the tax authorities' fault.

We owe 120,000 francs
on our first instalment.

I have jaundice!

I won't be convalescing
for 100 years.

Don't get carried away!

I wanna make my comeback
at the Olympia!

<i>- Anything else?
- Yes, Danielle, stop giving in to her.

I know, but, I can't babysit her
all alone, Loulou.

She shouldn't be out of
the hospital, yet.

The Olympia will be a catastrophe.

She needs a challenge.

Not challenges doomed to fail
in advance!

'Cause I'm the one on the hook
explaining to the insurers

that we must cancel everything.

We must decide for her, period.

Whether she likes it or not!

<i>Right then, I said to myself,
'Edith, it's finished.'</i>

- You lost another one.
- Did he cheat on you?

You think if he did, I'd be
telling it just like this?

He leaves the restaurant.
I sneak out after him.

My Marcel went across New York
to eat with an old blind black boxer

whom he'd met some years before.
Do you realize?...

Not many guys like that, on earth.

"Marcel! My Marcel!"

- Like he's the only man, alive.
- The only man who counts.

Wanna know something, Ginou,
I'll never have him.

He'll never be mine. 'Cause he'll
never leave his wife and children.

He phones her every day.

I pretend I don't see him.
I want him to be happy.

I'll be back.

<i>I could'a been Edith Piaf.</i>

But, there's more to life
than singing.

Marcel, I can't take it anymore.
Call Orly, book a flight tonight.

Coming by boat will take
just long enough for me to die.

I miss you, Marcel.

I can't be separated from you.

- Why can't I return to Paris?
- Hold on.

- Why am I here being Madame's lapdog?
- Stop it!

Rum, coke, whisky...

Everyone treats me like shit,
around here.

I preferred it when we'd
get drunk in rue Belleville.

You let me down.

Stop it, Momone!

Pour her onto a boat!

I can take the boat, myself.

To your career, Edith!

I beg you, Marcel, leave tonight.
Do it for me.

- You sleep late when I'm not here.
- My God, Marcel! Thank you.

I'll make you coffee.
Don't budge.

I will serve you.

What are you doing there?

I knew you'd come.

Lucien tore his hair out
trying to get tickets.

I have a gift for you.

What's with the sour puss?

You need time under a sunlamp.
Your complexion is livid.

Ginou!

I'm looking for the watch!

Ginou!

What's wrong with you?
I'm looking for the watch!

It was in a long, red Cartier box.
It was right here, goddamit!

What's the matter with all of you?

I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
Where is that watch?

I'm looking for Marcel's watch!

What?

Louis? What's happening?

You must be brave, Edith.

Is it Marcel?

- Love.</i>

Who are you knitting for?

For anyone who'll wear my sweater.

<i>Voilà, it's over.
Hope it wasn't too long.

- Thank you so much, madame.
- Thank you mademoiselle.

- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.

? [Non, je ne regrette rien]

No, nothing at all
<i>? Non, rien de rien</i>

No, I regret nothing
<i>? Non, je ne regrette rien</i>

Neither the good done to me,
<i>? Ni le bien qu'on m'a fait</i>

Nor the evil
<i>? Ni le mal</i>

It's all the same to me
<i>? Tout ça m'est bien égal...</i>

No, nothing at all
<i>? Non, rien de rien</i>

No, I regret nothing
<i>? Non, je ne regrette rien</i>

It's been paid for
<i>? C'est payé,</i>

Swept away
<i>? balayé...</i>

Forgotten
<i>? oublié</i>

I don't give a damn for the past
<i>? Je me fous du passé</i>

With my souvenirs
<i>? Avec mes souvenirs</i>

I've lit a bonfire
<i>? J'ai allumé le feu</i>

My chagrins, my pleasures
<i>? Mes chagrins, mes plaisirs</i>

I've no need of them
<i>? Je n'ai plus besoin d'eux</i>

Old loves: swept away
<i>? Balayés les amours</i>

Along with their thrills
<i>? Avec leurs trémolos</i>

Swept away for ever
<i>? Balayés pour toujours</i>

I'll start again at zero
<i>? Je repars à zéro</i>

No, nothing at all
<i>? Non, rien de rien</i>

No, I regret nothing
<i>? Non, je ne regrette rien</i>

Neither the good done to me
<i>? Ni le bien qu'on m'a fait</i>?

Nor the evil
<i>? Ni le mal</i>

It's all the same to me
<i>? Tout ça m'est bien égal</i>

No, nothing at all
<i>? Non, rien de rien</i>

No, I regret nothing
<i>? Non, je ne regrette rien</i>

Since my life
<i>? Car ma vie,

And my joy
<i>? car mes joies</i>

Today
<i>? Aujourd'hui</i>

Begins with you.
<i>? Ça commence avec toi</i>
